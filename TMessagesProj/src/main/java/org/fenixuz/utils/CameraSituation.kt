/**
 * Novagram: which camera a round video note starts recording from — front (default) or rear.
 *
 * Backed by device-only "db" prefs (no Firebase). The value is loaded once and cached in [isFront],
 * so the hot read at InstantCameraView (when the camera opens) is a plain field access — no disk
 * touch per recording. Writes go through the property setter and persist async via apply().
 *
 * It is chosen in FenixSettings (a "Camera: Front/Rear" row that opens a single-choice dialog); there
 * is no per-recording front/back popup anymore — the saved choice is used every time. The
 * in-recording flip button still switches the live camera, but deliberately does NOT overwrite this
 * preference, so the setting stays the authoritative "start" camera for the next round video.
