/**
 * Novagram "Protect from strangers" — one-on-one chats with people NOT in your contacts (not bots,
 * not yourself, not Telegram's own official/support accounts) are filed into a separate "Stranger
 * chats" inbox: hidden from the main list, silent (no notification), and excluded from the unread
 * badges.
 *
 * STICKY by design (user request 2026-06-13): a stranger that appears while the shield is ON is
 * CAPTURED into the inbox and STAYS there even after the shield is turned OFF — because it is still a
 * stranger. A NEW stranger that writes while the shield is OFF is NOT captured, so it shows up in the
 * main list normally (capturing only happens while protection is on). If a captured stranger later
 * becomes a contact, [isStranger] turns false and they leave the inbox / reappear in the main list.
 *
 * The single source of truth is [belongsInInbox] = "a stranger AND (shield on OR captured)". Every
 * surface uses it: the dialog list (hide / inbox), notifications, and both unread badges — so they
 * never disagree (no "badge counts a chat you can't see").
 *
 * The captured set is PER-ACCOUNT (2026-06-15): dialog ids are account-scoped, so the same id being a
 * stranger in account A must never hide it in account B. The set is also self-pruned on every toggle —
 * ids whose user became a contact or whose dialog was deleted are dropped — so it can't grow forever.
 *
 * Clean, optimised rewrite of pro's `MyContact` (which mutated storage on the render hot path with
 * Gson + blocking commit(), filtered in two places with O(N·M) loops, faked a paid-message cost,
 * spammed per-stranger network mutes, and force-enabled unrelated features). Here: one cached boolean
 * + lock-free per-account captured sets, O(1) hot-path reads, async writes, no network, device-only.
